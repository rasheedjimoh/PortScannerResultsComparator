# üîÅ Port Scanner Results Comparator (Python)

## Overview
A concise Python utility that runs multiple port scanners (`nmap`, `masscan`, `recon-ng`) against a single target and **compares the results** to highlight overlaps and discrepancies.  

This tool is built for lab use, tool validation, and result-parity analysis ‚Äî useful when you want to know *which scanners agree* on open ports and where differences occur.

---

## Key Features
- üß∞ **Multi-tool orchestration**: Runs `nmap`, `masscan`, and `recon-ng` from a single Python wrapper.  
- üîé **Result normalization & comparison**: Extracts open ports from each tool‚Äôs output and reports per-tool findings plus the intersection (ports all tools found).  
- üß™ **Quick parity checks**: Helps evaluate scanner accuracy and detect false positives/negatives across tools.  
- üß© **Extendable**: Easy to add more scanners or robust parsing logic (JSON/structured outputs).

---

## Why this script is useful
- Ideal for validating scan results in a controlled environment (lab, training, or tool evaluation).  
- Helps inform decisions on which scanner to trust for a given network or use case.  
- Great for documenting differences during pentest write-ups or research notes.

---

## How it works (high level)
1. The script executes each scanner as a subprocess and captures stdout.  
2. It parses the output to extract lines marked as `open` and collects the ports found by each tool.  
3. It prints each tool‚Äôs findings and computes the **common ports** present in the output of all three scanners.

---

## Usage
1. Ensure the required tools are installed and accessible in `PATH`: `nmap`, `masscan`, and `recon-ng`.  
2. Run the script:
```bash
python3 compare_scanner_results.py
# then enter the target host when prompted
````

**Example output**

```
Nmap found the following open ports: ['22', '80', '443']
Masscan found the following open ports: ['80', '443']
Recon-ng found the following open ports: ['22', '443']
The following ports were found open by all three tools: ['443']
```

## Caveats & Parsing Notes (important)

* üß© **Output formats vary**: The script uses simple text parsing (`split`, `in`, indices). Different tool versions, locales, or verbosity flags can break parsing.
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Execution environment**: `nmap` and `masscan` often require elevated privileges for raw packet scans; `masscan` can be high-impact on networks.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Different scan behaviors**: `nmap` (detailed & slower), `masscan` (very fast, asynchronous), and `recon-ng` (framework module) use different techniques ‚Äî results are not inherently comparable without normalization (e.g., consistent port lists, timing, and scan types).
* üîç **False positives/negatives**: Network conditions, firewall rules, rate limits, and timing can cause variation; interpret results accordingly.

---

## Safety & Ethics (must-read)

* **Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized scanning is illegal and can disrupt services.
* Use conservative settings on production networks. Notify defenders/stakeholders when running broad or fast scans.

## Implementation Note

This script is intentionally simple and readable ‚Äî a practical starting point for deeper tool-comparison work. Treat it as a lab utility and a foundation for building robust benchmarking pipelines.
